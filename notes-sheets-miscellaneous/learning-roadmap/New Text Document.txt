ðŸš€ Your Python DSA Roadmap: Watch + Practice
Phase 1: Data Structures (Foundations)
Goal: Build a solid understanding of core data structures and implement them yourself.

Topic	What to Watch	What to Practice
Big O Notation	FreeCodeCamp (00:00 - 16:00)	Understand Time & Space complexity. Do some quick exercises: calculate Big O for simple loops.
Arrays / Lists	FCC (16:00 - 40:00)	- Implement dynamic array manually (optional).
- LeetCode Easy: Two Sum, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock, Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Linked Lists	FCC (40:00 - 1:07:00)	- Implement singly and doubly linked lists.
- LeetCode Easy: Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists
Stacks & Queues	FCC (1:07:00 - 1:38:00)	- Implement stacks/queues using lists and linked lists.
- LeetCode Easy: Valid Parentheses, Min Stack
Hash Tables / Hash Maps	FCC (1:38:00 - 2:06:00)	- Implement a basic hash map.
- LeetCode Easy: Two Sum (again), Contains Duplicate
Trees (Binary Trees)	FCC (2:06:00 - 2:55:00)	- Implement a binary tree and tree traversals (pre, in, post order).
- LeetCode Easy: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree, Symmetric Tree
Binary Search Trees (BST)	FCC (2:55:00 - 3:31:00)	- Implement insertion, search, and deletion.
- LeetCode Easy: Validate BST, Lowest Common Ancestor
Heaps / Priority Queue	FCC (3:31:00 - 3:50:00)	- Implement a min-heap / max-heap.
- LeetCode Easy: Kth Largest Element in Array
Graphs (Basics)	FCC (3:50:00 - 4:32:00)	- Implement a graph (adjacency list/dict).
- LeetCode Easy: Find if Path Exists in Graph
Phase 2: Algorithms (Core Techniques)
Goal: Learn how to manipulate data structures to solve real problems.

Topic	What to Watch	What to Practice
Recursion & Backtracking	FCC (4:32:00 - 5:02:00)	- Classic recursion: Factorial, Fibonacci.

Sorting Algorithms	FCC (5:02:00 - 5:45:00)	- Implement Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
- LeetCode Easy: Sort Colors
Searching Algorithms	FCC (5:45:00 - 6:05:00)	- Implement Binary Search.
- LeetCode Easy: Binary Search, First Bad Version
Breadth-First Search (BFS)	FCC (6:05:00 - 6:34:00)	- LeetCode Easy: Flood Fill
- LeetCode Medium: Word Ladder
Depth-First Search (DFS)	FCC (6:34:00 - 7:04:00)	- LeetCode Medium: Number of Islands, Surrounded Regions
