🔴 Phase 4: Real Interview Simulation (2–4 weeks)
📌 Mix of all topics
Use LeetCode's "Top Interview 150" or "Blind 75"

Time-bound: Solve 2–3 problems/day

Focus on:

Clean code

Time & Space complexity analysis

Debugging under pressure

⚫ Phase 5: Final Touch
✅ Revise all concepts

✅ Track weak areas and redo those problems

✅ Mock interviews (use LeetCode contest problems or platforms like Pramp, Interviewing.io)

✅ Study system design if targeting FAANG or senior roles

✅ Total Timeline: ~4–6 months (with consistency)
🗓️ 1 hour/day: For students or part-timers

🗓️ 2–3 hours/day: For job seekers

🔁 Bonus Tips
📓 Maintain a DSA Journal or Notion to log mistakes and learnings.

🔍 Use the "Discuss" section for other approaches.

📈 Track your progress weekly.

🧠 Focus on quality of understanding, not just problem count.

If you want, I can generate a Notion template or printable PDF tracker to help you follow this plan step-by-step. Let me know!
